Material Components
===================

Stateless UI components for react that follow material design.

Introduction
------------

material-components is a library of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (15.0.0) user interface components based on [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/).

material-components are completely stateless making them an ideal companion to libraries such as [Cerebral](http://christianalfoni.com/cerebral/) or [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/). But they can also be used with other flux based frameworks or even without a framework at all.

The development of material-components has been sponsored by [Elastic Time](http://www.elastictime.com/).
